<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	The assignment given was to design a webpage about ourselves. In this assignment we lernt many things. Some of the key thing we learned is how to design a web page. We used HTML and CSS to design our web page. Web page design means to create a page we like which can be acessed from web browers. For this we use HTML. HTML(Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is code which we use to wirte in the page which we are goint to design. For designing the web page which we made by HTML we use CSS. There are different types of css which we can use to make our page attractive. The key think for the designer to keep in their mind is to make the web page eye-friendly which means our eyes doesn't get stressed out if we browse the page for a long time. In this assignment we had to make different pages such as home, about, cv, social, modelsgp and contact. All the web pages should be responsive as there are more than 65% mobile users.
</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>
	At the home page I made a navigation bar at the top that contains a logo and navigation to different pages that i made. In the body part I added a photo of myself and bellow that I wrote some information about me. I used different HTML and CSS codes to design this page.

<h2>CV</h2>
<p>
	In the cv page it is where we write about our intrest, work experences, education, hobbies and much more. SO my cv consists of everything that a cv page should have and i also made it by using some eye friendly colors. I have also included my address, contact number and email address.

<h2>Social</h2>
<p>
	In the social page i added all the social icons from which people can get in touch with me. This helps people to know more about me from different types of social medias. There are different social medias that people can get in touch with me such as facbook, twitter, google and skype

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
	In the contact page I have given all my contact information so that the people can contact me easily. I have also added a form submition which is for those people who like to talk with me directly through this website. There is a copy right and the footer of the webpage including social icons and a google map where people can find my location easily.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	By doing this assginemt I got to learn more about web designing by using HTML and CSS. I got the idea how a web page should be create and that it shouldn't be too much colorful. The color used in the webpage is the most important as we need to use eye-friendly color. I got to know about myself too through this assignment as this was about me. I learned how to add google map in the webpage. Making a webpage is not a simple task it takes a lot of research and hardwork which i got to know through this assignment.
